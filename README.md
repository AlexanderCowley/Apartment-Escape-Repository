# Apartment-Escape-Repository

Description: This repository is used for a small game project with the intention of learning C# using the Unity Game Engine.

Mechanics: The player can move in three dimensions, zoom in by right clicking objects and interact with objects by clicking the left mouse button. The player is currently able to pick up keys and use them to unlock doors that require them.

Story: You wake up from a night of drinking in another person's apartment. You have to search the apartment to find your way out.
